Projet Web3 2021
9/8/2021 commit: added some user settings and cart interface since I changed the initial style of the website
and now working on add to cart iwth php since before it was written with javascript and that can cause the user
to change it from inspect element in chrome.That way its safer.
9/13/2021 commit: cart is now working using ajax. it just need to be implemented for mobile interface and 
on other pages.
